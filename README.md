# Timestamp Microservice

This is the boilerplate code for the Timestamp Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice

## This is a copy of my completed code for the FreeCodeCamp code for the first Node.js/Express API challenge. A live link of the date microservice API is [HERE](https://boilerplate-project-timestamp.js1313.repl.co/) and can be used by adding /api/ to the URL, and then adding a valid date (e.g. 2023-6-26) or unix timestamp.
